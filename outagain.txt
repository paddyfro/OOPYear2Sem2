twinkle twinkle little star
mary had a little lamb
the elephant is a bonnie bird
it flits from tree to tree
it lays its nest in a rhubarb bush
and whistles like a bee
one fine day in the middle of the night
mrs mc grath went out to shite
she say a ghost eating toast
halfway up the lamp post
one fine day in the middle of the night
a fire broke out in the middle of teh ocean
three blind men were the first to see it
fire engine came racing round the corner like a snail
ran over a dead dog and early killed it
a baldy headed man came running down the stairs
